# overview
construct a graph of artists and users; keep track of all nodes and edges
each time a connection is made between two users, both users contact the server
server verifies that connection is valid, updates graph, recomputes degrees for each node (user)
TODO: is the graph locked every time? can we respond to multiple queries in parallel?

key nodes by some uuid (wristband? hardware identifier?)
data is stored as json in three sections:
-set {uuid neighbor} // edges to neighbor users, which is already sufficient to encode the entire graph
-map {uuid artist : list [uuid user]} // describes the particular nodes (users) along the shortest path to the artist
-map {uuid artist : int distance} // so that computation is not required upon query
which are updated as necessary each time graph is updated
