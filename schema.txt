# data format
construct a graph of artists and users
each time a connection is made between two users, both users contact the server
server verifies that connection is valid, updates graph, recomputes degrees for each node (user)
done in a locking fashion such that the shortest path is computed
IMPORTANT: ALL edges must be maintained

key nodes by some uuid (wristband? hardware identifier?)
data is stored as json with entries for each artist, and storing all nodes with which user has interacted with
multiple possible formats for json:
-for each artist, maintain only an ordered list of references (edges) leading to the artist; don't store the score in json, rather, dynamically compute for each query; does lots of work on queries, but not on updates
*for each artist, maintain the edge list for the current shortest path as well as a value (distance); this value must be updated each time the graph is updated, but does not need to be recomputed on each query; does slightly more work on updates, but none on queries
